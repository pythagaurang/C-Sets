# Sets in C
##### Assignment 3 of Data Structures
In maths, a set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects. In this application I used the concept of linked list to create ordered sets. You can add an element, delete an element and display the set. All the elements in the set will always be unique and sorted in an ascending order.  I used the concept of dynamic arrays to create a list of ordered sets. This list has 4 functions that let you, Add a set to the list, 
Delete a set from the list, Edit a set and display all the sets.
